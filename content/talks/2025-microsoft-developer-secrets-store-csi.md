Storing secrets in Kubernetes via native Secret objects has long been standard practice - but evolving security and compliance requirements demand more secure approaches. In this episode, we introduce the Secrets Store CSI Driver, a Kubernetes SIG Auth subproject that securely integrates your workloads with external secret stores like Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager, and AWS Secrets Manager. The CSI Driver mounts secrets directly into your pods at runtime, enabling zero-touch rotation and significantly reducing the risk of secret exposure or compromise. Join Anish and Ben as they demonstrate how to use the Secrets Store CSI Driver to meet modern security and compliance needs while simplifying secret management in Kubernetes.
