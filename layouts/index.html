    <p>I work on the Azure Container Upstream team building features for Kubernetes upstream and various CNCF projects that power Azure Kubernetes Service. I'm a co-chair of Kubernetes SIG Auth and a maintainer of the Secrets Store CSI Driver project.</p>
    
    <p>My work focuses on cloud-native security and open source leadership. I drive security innovations across the full spectrum—from identity and authentication to secrets management and encryption—while maintaining critical CNCF security projects.</p>
    
    <p>I share my experience through <a href="/talks/">conference talks</a> and <a href="/blogs/">technical writing</a>, covering practical security implementations and emerging cloud-native technologies. My goal is to make Kubernetes security more accessible and actionable for teams worldwide.</p>
    
    <p>Interested in collaborating on open source security projects or discussing cloud-native best practices? I'd love to connect.</p>
